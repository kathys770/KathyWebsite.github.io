									<p>How it Started: My Journey from Healthcare to Technology</p>
									<p>In the heart of healthcare, I found my purpose: 
										aiding those on their journey to recovery. 
										For nearly 14 years, I served as an infusion coordinator, 
										dedicating my efforts to assisting individuals in need. 
										My role involved navigating the complex world of health insurance, 
										advocating for patients to secure approvals for specialized 
										infusion medications. Ensuring efficient delivery, 
										I helped patients access treatments crucial for enhancing 
										their day-to-day lives. My days in healthcare were deeply fulfilling,
										but a lingering passion for technology tugged at my soul. 
										I've always been fascinated by the way technology shapes 
										our world, and I yearned to be a part of that
										 transformation.</p>
									<p>So, I decided to take the plunge and shift gears into the world of technology. 
										It's a leap filled with excitement and the promise of new challenges. 
										As I embark on this journey, I bring with me the empathy and determination 
										cultivated during my years in healthcare.
										My goal remains unchanged: to be helpful, to learn, 
										and to contribute in meaningful ways,
										now in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
									
									<p>I started my educational journey by earning my Associate Degree in Cybersecurity in 2021. 
										Now, I'm deepening my expertise by pursuing a Bachelor's in IT Business Management where I am due to 
										graduate in 2024. This transition isn't just a career change for me; 
										it's a deeply personal exploration of my passions and a commitment to growth.</p>
														
									<p>I'm truly grateful for your time and interest in getting to know me better.
										Thank you for taking the time to read my story and learn about my journey.
										If you have any further questions or if there's anything specific
										you'd like to know, please don't hesitate to reach out. </p>
									<p>- Kathy San</p>
